    <p><img src='images/Vivian.jpeg' class="img-circle" alt="Cinque Terre" height= 300px></p>
    <p>At the tender age of 9, Vivian took the first Scuba Diving lesson to go on an adventure with her favourite Blue spotted stingray on Sipadan island. She was later aspired to become a Marine Biologist but soon caught up in the area of Linguistics in college!
Yet the adventurous mindset has transformed the once curious scuba diver to a full blown Management Consultant and the Co-founder on an entrepreneurial chatbot project, where she can contribute to product development at the ever-changing start up world as much as the evolving underwater landscape.</p>

      <h3>Iran</h3>
      <p><img src='images/Colours.jpg' class="img-circle" alt="Cinque Terre" height= 200px></p>
      <p>It took us half a year to plan for the trip to #Iran and now we made it!!! Experiencing an extreme switch of weather from a humid Hong Kong to a hot/dry-like-an-oven Yazd in #Iran, we are suffering from skin problem, swollen wound (swollen gum, headache, and dry mouth) ..... tough....but it didnâ€™t stop us from meeting the locals and getting awed by the magnificent landscape and architecture!! Although we canâ€™t speak Persian body language is the most genuine and natural interactions ðŸ˜Š </p>

      <p>Where can you get the legit bubble tea? For sure Taiwan! Within these 4 days we have tried out bubble tea from several stores and let us share our favourite! Thick yet silky milk top mixed with fresh milk, hot brown sugar syrup, LapHuTangâ€™s bubble tea is top notch. Second place goes to the Diagon Alley (which is less sweet)</p>

      <p>Paradise of scuba diving: Okinawa! So glad that weâ€™ve witnessed the life of two instructors/ dive master who came all the way from Hong Kong to Okinawa (working holiday visa) to chase for their dream! I realised opportunities are always there- it only depends on how you prioritise the bucket list and what you are inspired by. What are your priorities? Or are they only excuses that become your burden? #yolo</p>

      <h3>Money saving tips on travel food cost</h3>
      <p><img src='images/Money.jpg' class="img-circle" alt="Cinque Terre" height= 200px></p>
      <p>Sometimes food cost might be less predictable than the transportation or accommodation price in your travel planning. The simple solution is to pack a bag of protein bars all the time (just in case)  but at the same time save some money for local cuisines! We need a balance! Do some research about the most common food at your destination. Usually those are the cheapest, ranging from fruits, pastry to mains (or beer! In Germany beer might be even cheaper than bottled water!) ! One of the best way to save is buying food in the supermarket but the usual problem is the lack of cooking facilities; so we would recommend buying an electric kettle (at least you can cook pasta and couscous!) even if thereâ€™s no stove and pots at the hostel.</p>

      <h3>How to find accommodation?</h3>
      <p><img src='images/Hostel.jpg' class="img-circle" alt="Cinque Terre" height= 200px></p>
      <p>accommodation is always our major fixed travel cost. If weâ€™re able to find cheap sleep over option it will definitely help you keep more money in your wallet. If you go wth a group, we prefer staying in apartments which offer several benefits including having separated bedrooms, having our own laundry, get access to full kitchen (save money by not eating out every night), and usually itâ€™s a better deal than booking a single bed in hostel.
If you are a more adventurous person and love to dig into local culture, coach surfing might be an option for you. Many might concern personal safety so check the review page at the app and see how travellers comments on the specific host. (You will find a lot of interesting facts about this family by simply looking at the genuine comments from other travellers- that saves you lots of time to investigate!) But of course, your choice will depends on your budget, destination, comfort level and the number of companions and your own interest.</p>

      <h3>Transportation cost and how to travel like a local</h3>
      <p><img src='images/Local.jpg' class="img-circle" alt="Cinque Terre" height= 200px></p>
      <p>Whether you are a broke student, or a backpacker, itâ€™s always great to find countless cheap transportation options during travelling. why spend extra when you donâ€™t need to? If affordability is what you are after, we recommend travelling around by bus. It might not be as comfortable or convenient as train but it simply comes at a fraction of the cost. Consider the bus companies like Flixbus and get a pass called Interflix. Budget airline can take you from one place to another at ludicrously low cost. Find the flight deals at Skyscanner, Momondo; (and order at Black Friday night; that helps too!). and the cheapest way to travel is definitely the BlaBlaCar which is a carpool service that matches up drivers and passengers who are going to the same places. You are pitching in for gas and other expenses in exchange for a seat in somebodyâ€™s car. It has a great rating system and we tried that in Spain! Not bad indeed!</p>
